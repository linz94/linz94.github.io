I am a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Orcun Goksel at ETH Zurich.
My research interests include computer vision and machine learning for medical imaging applications.
I am currently working on combining tranditional computer graphics techniques with data-driven approches to improve medical simulators for minimally invasive surgical training.
